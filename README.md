# LocalSnips (Preview)

**Interactive Demonstration of the AI-Powered Local Knowledge Base**

[**View Live Demo**](https://yeraylois.github.io/localsnips-preview/)

## About This Demo

This repository hosts a **static, high-fidelity simulation** of the LocalSnips application. It allows users to explore the complete User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) directly in the browser, without the need for a Docker environment or local database installation.

Note: This demo uses **simulated data** and runs entirely client-side to demonstrate the interface capabilities.

## Key Features

### 🧠 Knowledge Graph
Visualize connections between code snippets and collections. The previews includes an interactive force-directed graph that demonstrates how LocalSnips organizes complex technical knowledge.

### 🎨 Dynamic Theming
Experience the custom "Window Tint" engine. The application adapts its entire color palette—including glassmorphism effects, borders, and text contrast—in real-time based on your preference (Light, Dark, or System).

### 🛠️ Service Manager (Simulation)
A pixel-perfect recreation of the native macOS service control utility. This module demonstrates how the actual application manages local infrastructure (Docker containers, PostgreSQL, Redis, and AI Workers), complete with realistic state transitions and animations.

### ⚡ Technical Capabilities
- **Search & Filtering**: Instant client-side search across collections and tags.
- **Conflict Resolution**: UI flows for handling snippet synchronization conflicts.
- **Snippet Management**: Detailed views for code, metadata, and properties.

## Navigation

- **Dashboard**: The central hub for snippets and recent activity.
- **Graph View**: Visual exploration of your knowledge base.
- **Service Manager**: Infrastructure control panel simulation.
